# File Transfer over Netcat Script

A robust Python utility for transferring files between systems using netcat (nc) as the transport layer. This script provides both sender and receiver functionality with proper error handling, progress indication, and file integrity verification.

## Features

- **Bidirectional Transfer**: Send or receive files between systems
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time transfer progress with byte counts
- **File Integrity**: SHA256 checksum calculation for verification
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Timeout Support**: Configurable network timeouts
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems
- **Safe Operations**: Input validation and confirmation prompts

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Netcat (nc) installed on the system

### Python Dependencies
This script uses only Python standard library modules:
- `argparse` - Command-line argument parsing
- `subprocess` - Process execution
- `hashlib` - Checksum calculation
- `pathlib` - File path handling
- `os`, `sys`, `time`, `signal` - System utilities

## Installation

### 1. Install Netcat

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install netcat
```

**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**
```bash
sudo yum install nc
# or for newer versions:
sudo dnf install nc
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install netcat
```

### 2. Download the Script

Save the Python script as `netcat_transfer.py` and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x netcat_transfer.py
```

## Usage

The script operates in two modes: **send** (client) and **receive** (server).

### Basic Syntax

```bash
python netcat_transfer.py {send|receive} [options]
```

### Sending Files

To send a file to a remote system:

```bash
python netcat_transfer.py send --host <target_host> --port <port> --file <filepath>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Send a document to a specific IP
python netcat_transfer.py send --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8080 --file document.pdf

# Send to a hostname with custom timeout
python netcat_transfer.py send --host server.example.com --port 9000 --file archive.zip --timeout 60

# Send quietly (no progress output)
python netcat_transfer.py send --host 10.0.0.5 --port 8080 --file data.txt --quiet
```

### Receiving Files

To receive a file from a remote system:

```bash
python netcat_transfer.py receive --port <port> --output <output_filepath>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Receive a file on port 8080
python netcat_transfer.py receive --port 8080 --output received_file.pdf

# Receive with custom timeout
python netcat_transfer.py receive --port 9000 --output backup.zip --timeout 120

# Receive quietly
python netcat_transfer.py receive --port 8080 --output data.txt --quiet
```

## Command-Line Options

### Send Mode Options

| Option | Short | Description | Required |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `--host` | `-H` | Target hostname or IP address | Yes |
| `--port` | `-p` | Target port number (1-65535) | Yes |
| `--file` | `-f` | Path to file to send | Yes |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | Timeout in seconds (default: 30) | No |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Suppress progress output | No |

### Receive Mode Options

| Option | Short | Description | Required |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `--port` | `-p` | Port to listen on (1-65535) | Yes |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output file path | Yes |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | Timeout in seconds (default: 30) | No |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Suppress progress output | No |

## Complete Transfer Example

Here's a complete example of transferring a file between two systems:

**On the receiving system (192.168.1.100):**
```bash
python netcat_transfer.py receive --port 8080 --output received_document.pdf
```

**On the sending system:**
```bash
python netcat_transfer.py send --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8080 --file document.pdf
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Unencrypted Transfer**: This tool transfers files in plain text over the network. Do not use for sensitive data over untrusted networks.

2. **Network Security**: Ensure proper firewall rules are in place. Only allow connections from trusted sources.

3. **File Permissions**: The script will create output files with default permissions. Review and adjust as needed.

4. **Authentication**: This tool provides no authentication mechanism. Anyone who can reach the listening port can send/receive files.

5. **Intended Use**: This tool is designed for legitimate file transfers in trusted environments such as:
   - Local network file transfers
   - System administration tasks
   - Development and testing environments
   - Network troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Netcat not found" error:**
- Install netcat using your system's package manager
- Ensure netcat is in your system PATH

**"Connection refused" error:**
- Verify the receiving system is listening on the specified port
- Check firewall settings on both systems
- Ensure the port number is correct and available

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Check file permissions for the source file
- Ensure write permissions for the output directory
- Use ports above 1024 for non-root users

**Transfer timeout:**
- Increase the timeout value using `--timeout`
- Check network connectivity between systems
- Verify no network equipment is dropping connections

### Debug Mode

For additional troubleshooting, you can run netcat commands manually:

**Receiver:**
```bash
nc -l -p 8080 > output_file
```

**Sender:**
```bash
nc target_host 8080 < input_file
```

## File Integrity

The script automatically calculates SHA256 checksums for transferred files. Compare the checksums shown on both sender and receiver to verify file integrity:

```
SHA256 checksum: a1b2c3d4e5f6789...
```

You can also verify manually using:
```bash
sha256sum filename
```

## Performance Notes

- Transfer speed depends on network bandwidth and latency
- The script uses 8KB chunks for optimal performance
- Large files are handled efficiently with streaming
- Progress is updated in real-time during transfer

## Limitations

- No built-in encryption (use over secure networks only)
- Single file transfers (no directory support)
- No resume capability for interrupted transfers
- Requires netcat to be installed on both systems
- No built-in compression
