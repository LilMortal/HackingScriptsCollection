# Memory Information Tool

A comprehensive Python script that displays detailed system memory information including RAM usage, swap usage, and per-process memory consumption. This tool is designed for system administrators, developers, and anyone who needs to monitor system memory usage.

## Features

- **Basic Memory Information**: Display total, used, available, and free memory
- **Detailed Memory Breakdown**: Show buffers, cache, active, and inactive memory (Linux)
- **Swap Memory Information**: Display swap usage statistics
- **Process Memory Monitoring**: Show top memory-consuming processes
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Human-readable text or JSON format
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous memory monitoring with customizable intervals
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- psutil library

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the script** to your local machine.

2. **Install the required dependency**:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

   Or if you're using Python 3 specifically:
   ```bash
   pip3 install psutil
   ```

3. **Make the script executable** (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x memory_info.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Display basic memory information:
```bash
python memory_info.py
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--detailed` | `-d` | Show detailed memory breakdown including buffers and cache |
| `--processes N` | `-p N` | Show top N memory-consuming processes |
| `--json` | `-j` | Output information in JSON format |
| `--monitor SECONDS` | `-m SECONDS` | Monitor memory usage every N seconds |
| `--version` | `-v` | Show version information |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message |

### Example Commands

1. **Basic memory information**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py
   ```

2. **Detailed memory information**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py --detailed
   ```

3. **Show top 5 memory-consuming processes**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py --processes 5
   ```

4. **Detailed information with top 10 processes**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py --detailed --processes 10
   ```

5. **Output in JSON format**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py --json
   ```

6. **Monitor memory every 3 seconds**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py --monitor 3
   ```

7. **Detailed monitoring with processes**:
   ```bash
   python memory_info.py --detailed --processes 5 --monitor 2
   ```

## Sample Output

### Basic Output
```
============================================================
SYSTEM MEMORY INFORMATION
============================================================
Timestamp: 2025-06-22T10:30:15.123456
System: Linux

VIRTUAL MEMORY:
  Total:     15.64 GB
  Available: 8.45 GB
  Used:      6.23 GB (39.8%)
  Free:      9.41 GB

SWAP MEMORY:
  Total:     2.00 GB
  Used:      0.12 GB (6.0%)
  Free:      1.88 GB
```

### JSON Output
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-22T10:30:15.123456",
  "system": "Linux",
  "virtual_memory": {
    "total_gb": 15.64,
    "available_gb": 8.45,
    "used_gb": 6.23,
    "free_gb": 9.41,
    "percentage_used": 39.8
  },
  "swap_memory": {
    "total_gb": 2.0,
    "used_gb": 0.12,
    "free_gb": 1.88,
    "percentage_used": 6.0
  }
}
```

## Platform-Specific Features

### Linux
- Shows buffers, cached, shared, active, and inactive memory
- Provides detailed breakdown of memory usage

### Windows
- Shows basic memory and swap information
- Process memory monitoring available

### macOS
- Shows basic memory and swap information
- Process memory monitoring available

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing dependencies
- Insufficient permissions for process information
- Invalid command-line arguments
- System-specific memory access issues

## Monitoring Mode

When using the `--monitor` option:
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring
- The display refreshes at the specified interval
- Screen is cleared between updates for better readability

## Notes and Limitations

- **Permissions**: Some process information may require elevated privileges
- **Performance**: Monitoring mode with process information may have higher CPU usage
- **Accuracy**: Memory values are rounded to 2 decimal places for readability
- **Process Access**: Some processes may not be accessible due to security restrictions

## Ethical Use and Warnings

This tool is designed for legitimate system monitoring and administration purposes:

- ✅ **Appropriate Uses**:
  - System performance monitoring
  - Debugging memory issues
  - System administration tasks
  - Educational purposes

- ❌ **Do Not Use For**:
  - Unauthorized access to other users' processes
  - Circumventing system security measures
  - Any malicious activities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **`psutil` not found**:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

2. **Permission denied for some processes**:
   - This is normal; the tool will skip inaccessible processes
   - Run with elevated privileges if needed for complete process information

3. **Script doesn't run on Windows**:
   - Use `python memory_info.py` instead of `./memory_info.py`
   - Ensure Python is in your PATH

## Dependencies

- **psutil** (>=5.0.0): Cross-platform library for system and process monitoring
