# Webhook-based Recon Reporter

A comprehensive Python script for performing network reconnaissance and security assessments, with automated reporting via webhooks. This tool is designed for security professionals, penetration testers, and system administrators who need to perform reconnaissance tasks and receive automated reports.

## Features

- **Multi-target reconnaissance**: Scan single targets or batch process from files
- **Comprehensive scanning**: DNS lookups, port scanning, HTTP reconnaissance, and WHOIS queries
- **Flexible scan types**: Choose from basic, full, port-only, or web-only scans
- **Webhook integration**: Automatic reporting to Discord, Slack, or custom webhook endpoints
- **Concurrent processing**: Multi-threaded port scanning for improved performance
- **Detailed reporting**: JSON output with comprehensive scan results
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling and input validation
- **Command-line interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with comprehensive options

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Network connectivity for webhook reporting

### Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Optional Dependencies

For advanced port scanning capabilities:
```bash
pip install python-nmap
```

Note: The `whois` system command should be available for WHOIS lookups (pre-installed on most Linux/macOS systems).

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or download the script:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/webhook_recon_reporter.py
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x webhook_recon_reporter.py
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Scan a single target and send results to a Discord webhook:
```bash
python webhook_recon_reporter.py --target example.com --webhook-url https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
```

### Advanced Usage Examples

**Batch scanning from file:**
```bash
python webhook_recon_reporter.py --target-file targets.txt --webhook-url https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK --scan-type full
```

**Basic scan with JSON output:**
```bash
python webhook_recon_reporter.py --target 192.168.1.1 --webhook-url https://your-webhook.com/endpoint --scan-type basic --output results.json
```

**Port-only scan with custom timeout:**
```bash
python webhook_recon_reporter.py --target example.com --webhook-url https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx --scan-type port-only --timeout 5
```

**Web reconnaissance only:**
```bash
python webhook_recon_reporter.py --target example.com --webhook-url https://your-webhook.com --scan-type web-only
```

**Test mode (no webhook sending):**
```bash
python webhook_recon_reporter.py --target example.com --webhook-url https://example.com --no-webhook --output test_results.json
```

## Security Considerations

### Ethical Use

This tool is designed for **authorized security testing only**. Users must ensure they have proper authorization before scanning any targets. Unauthorized scanning may violate:

- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States
- Computer Misuse Act in the United Kingdom
- Similar laws in other jurisdictions

### Responsible Disclosure

- Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Respect rate limits and avoid overwhelming target systems
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities found
- Document all testing activities for compliance purposes

### Privacy and Data Protection

- Webhook URLs may contain sensitive authentication tokens
- Scan results may contain sensitive information about network infrastructure
- Store and transmit results securely
- Consider data retention policies for scan results

## Performance and Limitations

### Performance Characteristics

- **Concurrent port scanning**: Up to 50 concurrent connections
- **DNS resolution**: Cached for efficiency
- **HTTP requests**: 10-second default timeout
- **Rate limiting**: 0.5-second delay between targets

### Known Limitations

- **WHOIS dependency**: Requires system `whois` command
- **Network timeouts**: May miss services with slow response times
- **Webhook limits**: Discord/Slack have rate limits for webhook messages
- **Large target lists**: Consider breaking into smaller batches for very large scans
- **Firewall detection**: May not detect all filtered ports accurately

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **WHOIS command not found**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install whois
   
   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install whois
   
   # macOS
   brew install whois
   ```

2. **Webhook delivery failures**
   - Verify webhook URL is correct
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure webhook service is not rate-limiting
   - Test with `--no-webhook` flag first

3. **Permission denied errors**
   - Ensure script has execute permissions
   - Check file paths for target files and output files
   - Verify network permissions for scanning

4. **Timeout errors**
   - Increase timeout with `--timeout` parameter
   - Check network connectivity to targets
   - Consider firewall or network filtering
