A professional Python tool that creates a Telegram bot to send structured penetration testing reports to authorized channels or users. This tool helps security professionals share findings and collaborate on security assessments in a secure and organized manner.

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive Report Creation**: User-friendly interactive mode for creating detailed pentest reports
- **Structured Findings**: Organize findings with severity levels, CVSS scores, and detailed descriptions
- **Multiple Delivery Formats**: Send reports as formatted messages and JSON documents
- **Severity Classification**: Support for Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Info severity levels
- **CVSS Integration**: Include CVSS scores for quantitative risk assessment
- **Report Export**: Export complete reports to JSON format for documentation
- **Configuration Support**: Use configuration files for easier deployment
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of bot tokens and chat IDs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **Async Operations**: Efficient asynchronous HTTP operations

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Valid Telegram Bot Token (from @BotFather)
- Telegram chat ID or channel username

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone or Download

Save the script as `telegram_pentest_bot.py` and the README as `README.md`.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install aiohttp aiofiles
```

Or install from requirements file:

```bash
# Create requirements.txt with:
echo "aiohttp>=3.8.0" > requirements.txt
echo "aiofiles>=0.8.0" >> requirements.txt

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Telegram Bot

1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
2. Create a new bot with `/newbot`
3. Follow the instructions to get your bot token
4. Add your bot to the target chat/channel
5. Get the chat ID (you can use @userinfobot or check Telegram API)

## üìñ Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended for Beginners)

```bash
python telegram_pentest_bot.py --interactive
```

This mode will guide you through:
- Bot token and chat ID setup
- Report metadata configuration
- Adding multiple findings interactively
- Automatic report delivery

### Command Line Mode

#### Basic Usage
```bash
python telegram_pentest_bot.py --token YOUR_BOT_TOKEN --chat-id CHAT_ID
```

#### Using Configuration File
```bash
python telegram_pentest_bot.py --config config.json
```

### Configuration File Format

Create a `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "token": "123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "chat_id": "@your_channel_or_chat_id",
  "default_tester": "Security Team",
  "default_methodology": "OWASP Testing Guide v4.0"
}
```

## üéØ Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Web Application Penetration Test

```bash
python telegram_pentest_bot.py --interactive
```

Example interaction:
```
Target system/application: web.example.com
Tester name: John Doe
Testing scope: Web application security assessment
Methodology: OWASP Testing Guide v4.0

Finding title: SQL Injection in Login Form
Severity: Critical
Description: The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks
Impact: Unauthorized access to database and user credentials
Recommendation: Implement parameterized queries and input validation
CVSS Score: 9.8
```

### Scenario 2: Network Penetration Test

Use the interactive mode to document:
- Network scanning results
- Open ports and services
- Vulnerability findings
- Exploitation attempts
- Post-exploitation activities

## üîç Finding Classification

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate threat requiring urgent attention
- **High**: Significant security risk
- **Medium**: Moderate security concern
- **Low**: Minor security issue
- **Info**: Informational finding

### CVSS Score Integration
- Supports CVSS scores from 0.0 to 10.0
- Helps quantify risk levels
- Facilitates prioritization of remediation efforts

## üìä Report Format

The bot generates:

1. **Summary Report**: Overview with finding counts by severity
2. **Detailed Findings**: Individual findings with full descriptions
3. **JSON Export**: Complete machine-readable report

Sample report structure:
```
üîí Penetration Test Summary

Target: web.example.com
Tester: Security Professional
Date: 2025-06-18 14:30:00
Scope: Web application security assessment

Findings Summary:
üî¥ Critical: 2
üü† High: 3
üü° Medium: 5
üîµ Low: 2
‚ö™ Info: 1

Total Findings: 13
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `--token` | Telegram bot token | Yes* |
| `--chat-id` | Telegram chat ID or username | Yes* |
| `--config` | Path to JSON configuration file | No |
| `--interactive` | Run in interactive mode | No |
| `--version` | Show version information | No |

*Required unless using `--config` or `--interactive`

## üîí Security Considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

- **Authorized Use Only**: This tool is designed for legitimate penetration testing and security assessments
- **Secure Token Storage**: Never commit bot tokens to version control
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized personnel have access to the bot and reports
- **Data Sensitivity**: Be mindful of sensitive information in reports
- **Compliance**: Ensure usage complies with your organization's security policies

### Best Practices

1. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration:
   ```bash
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your_chat_id_here"
   ```

2. Restrict bot permissions to necessary chats only
3. Regularly rotate bot tokens
4. Use private channels for sensitive reports
5. Implement additional encryption for highly sensitive findings

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid bot token format"**
   - Verify token format: `123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
   - Check for extra spaces or characters

2. **"Failed to send message"**
   - Verify chat ID is correct
   - Ensure bot is added to the target chat/channel
   - Check bot permissions in the chat

3. **"Bot token verification failed"**
   - Confirm token is active and not revoked
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify no firewall blocking Telegram API

4. **Module import errors**
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install aiohttp aiofiles`
   - Check Python version (3.7+ required)

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by modifying the logging level in the script:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
