Hacking Scripts Collection
üß† Overview
Hey there! üëã I'm building this Hacking Scripts Collection as a personal toolbox ‚Äî a growing library of scripts and utilities related to ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity automation. This repo is my digital playground, where I experiment with offensive security techniques, automate tedious tasks, and explore vulnerabilities in a controlled and responsible way.

Each script in this collection is written with practical utility and educational value in mind. Whether I'm writing a quick scanner, password brute-forcer, exploit proof-of-concept, or OSINT tool, I aim to make the code readable, modular, and easy to build upon.

üéØ Why I Created This
I started this project to:

Sharpen my skills in scripting and automation

Reinforce my understanding of core hacking concepts

Save time with reusable tools during CTFs and labs

Share useful tools with fellow learners and ethical hackers

This repo is part cheat-sheet, part lab notebook ‚Äî and I hope it becomes a valuable resource for others too.

‚öíÔ∏è What's Inside?
Some of the categories/scripts I‚Äôm working on include:

Port scanners and service enumerators

Brute-force tools for passwords or login portals

OSINT utilities for gathering open-source intelligence

Payload generators for social engineering or testing

Exploitation scripts for common CVEs and misconfigurations

Post-exploitation helpers for privilege escalation or data exfiltration

Everything is meant for educational and lawful use only ‚Äî I strongly encourage responsible hacking and testing only in environments you own or are authorized to assess.
