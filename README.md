## Features

This collection aims to include a diverse set of scripts covering various domains of cybersecurity, such as:

- **Network Scanning & Enumeration**: Scripts to discover hosts, open ports, and services on a network.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Tools to identify potential weaknesses in systems and applications.
- **Payload Generation & Encoding**: Utilities for creating and manipulating malicious payloads.
- **Exploitation Helpers**: Scripts to assist in the exploitation phase, often requiring specific target knowledge.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Scripts for maintaining access, escalating privileges, and data exfiltration.
- **Forensics & Analysis**: Tools for analyzing system data, logs, or network traffic.
- **Automation**: Scripts to automate repetitive security tasks.
- **Web Application Security**: Specific scripts targeting common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To effectively use the scripts in this repository, you will generally need:

- **Python 3.x**: Many scripts are written in Python.
- **Bash/Zsh**: For shell scripts.
- **Standard Linux utilities**: `nmap`, `curl`, `wget`, etc., which are often pre-installed or easily installable on Kali Linux, Parrot OS, or other penetration testing distributions.
- **Specific libraries/modules**: Some Python scripts may require additional libraries (e.g., `requests`, `scapy`, `paramiko`). These can usually be installed via `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install <library_name>
Cloning the Repository
To get a local copy of the repository, use Git:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/LilMortal/HackingScriptsCollection.git](https://github.com/LilMortal/HackingScriptsCollection.git)
cd HackingScriptsCollection
Running Scripts
Each script is designed to perform a specific function and may have its own set of arguments or requirements.

Navigate to the script's directory:

Bash

cd <category_directory>/
For example:

Bash

cd network_scanners/
Check for usage instructions:
Many scripts will provide usage details when run with a -h or --help flag, or by simply running them without arguments.

Bash

python script_name.py --help
# or
./script_name.sh -h
Execute the script:
Follow the specific instructions for each script. For Python scripts:

Bash

python script_name.py [arguments]
For shell scripts:

Bash

./script_name.sh [arguments]
Ensure you have execute permissions for shell scripts: chmod +x script_name.sh
