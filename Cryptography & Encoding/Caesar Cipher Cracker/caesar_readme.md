# Caesar Cipher Cracker

A comprehensive Python tool for cracking Caesar cipher encrypted text using multiple sophisticated methods including brute force attack, frequency analysis, and interactive testing.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher Cracker is a command-line tool that can decrypt Caesar cipher encrypted text using three different approaches:

1. **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible shifts (0-25) and displays all results
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Uses English letter frequency analysis to determine the most likely decryption
3. **Interactive Mode**: Allows manual testing of different shift values
4. **Specific Shift**: Decrypt using a known or suspected shift value

The tool supports both direct text input and file input, making it versatile for different use cases.

## Features

- **Multiple Cracking Methods**: Choose from brute force, frequency analysis, or interactive modes
- **File and Text Input**: Accept encrypted text directly or from files
- **Frequency Analysis**: Uses chi-squared statistics against English letter frequency for intelligent decryption
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- **Clean Output**: Well-formatted results with ranking and scoring
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Case Preservation**: Maintains original text capitalization in decrypted output
- **Non-Alphabetic Character Preservation**: Keeps spaces, punctuation, and numbers unchanged

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)

### Setup

1. Download the `caesar_cipher_cracker.py` script
2. Make it executable (on Unix-like systems):
   ```bash
   chmod +x caesar_cipher_cracker.py
   ```

No additional installation steps are required as the script uses only Python's standard library.

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py [-h] (-t TEXT | -f FILE) [-m METHOD] [-s SHIFT]
```

### Arguments

- `-t, --text`: Encrypted text to crack (use quotes for text with spaces)
- `-f, --file`: Path to file containing encrypted text
- `-m, --method`: Cracking method - choices: `brute`, `frequency`, `interactive` (default: `frequency`)
- `-s, --shift`: Decrypt using a specific shift value (0-25)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message and usage examples

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Frequency Analysis (Recommended)
```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py -t "KHOOR ZRUOG" -m frequency
```

#### 2. Brute Force Attack
```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py -t "KHOOR ZRUOG" -m brute
```

#### 3. Interactive Mode
```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py -t "KHOOR ZRUOG" -m interactive
```

#### 4. Using a File Input
```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py -f encrypted_message.txt -m frequency
```

#### 5. Testing a Specific Shift
```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py -t "KHOOR ZRUOG" -s 3
```

#### 6. Complex Text with Punctuation
```bash
python caesar_cipher_cracker.py -t "Khoor, Zruog! Krz duh brx?" -m frequency
```

### Method Details

#### Frequency Analysis
- **Best for**: Most encrypted text, especially longer messages
- **How it works**: Compares letter frequency in decrypted text against standard English letter frequency
- **Output**: Ranked results with chi-squared scores (lower scores = more likely to be correct)

#### Brute Force
- **Best for**: Short messages or when you want to see all possibilities
- **How it works**: Tries all 26 possible shifts and displays results
- **Output**: Complete list of all possible decryptions

#### Interactive Mode
- **Best for**: When you want to test specific shifts manually
- **How it works**: Prompts user to enter shift values to test
- **Output**: Shows decryption for each tested shift

## Sample Output

### Frequency Analysis Example
```
Input text: KHOOR ZRUOG

Frequency Analysis Results (sorted by likelihood):
============================================================
Rank Shift ChiÂ²    Decrypted Text
------------------------------------------------------------
1    3     26.89   HELLO WORLD
2    15    156.73  DAHHK SKNHZ
3    7     189.45  DADDK OKNDR
...
Most likely decryption (shift 3): HELLO WORLD
```

### Brute Force Example
```
Input text: KHOOR ZRUOG

Brute Force Analysis:
==================================================
Shift  0: KHOOR ZRUOG
Shift  1: JGNNQ YQTNF
Shift  2: IFMMP XPSME
Shift  3: HELLO WORLD
Shift  4: GDKKN VNQKC
...
```

## File Format

When using file input (`-f` option), the file should contain the encrypted text. The script will:
- Read the entire file content
- Strip leading/trailing whitespace
- Validate that the file contains at least some letters
- Process the text using the specified method

Example file content:
```
WKLV LV D VHFUHW PHVVDJH
```

## Limitations and Notes

### Limitations
- **Caesar Cipher Only**: This tool is specifically designed for Caesar ciphers (simple substitution with fixed shift)
- **English Text**: Frequency analysis is optimized for English text
- **Case Sensitivity**: The tool preserves case but analyzes text case-insensitively
- **No Key Phrases**: Does not use dictionary attacks or known phrase detection

### Best Practices
- **Longer Text**: Frequency analysis works better with longer encrypted text (50+ characters)
- **Clean Input**: Remove or account for non-English characters that might skew frequency analysis
- **Multiple Methods**: Try frequency analysis first, then brute force if needed
- **Context Clues**: Use your knowledge of the expected content to validate results

### Performance
- **Fast Execution**: All methods run quickly even on longer texts
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses minimal memory regardless of text length
- **Scalable**: Performance scales linearly with text length

## Ethical Use and Legal Considerations

### Educational Purpose
This tool is intended for:
- Educational purposes and learning about cryptography
- CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions
- Analyzing historical ciphers
- Understanding encryption vulnerabilities

### Responsible Use
- **Only decrypt text you own or have permission to decrypt**
- **Do not use for unauthorized access to systems or data**
- **Respect privacy and confidentiality**
- **Follow applicable laws and regulations**

### Academic Integrity
If using this tool for academic purposes:
- Follow your institution's policies on tool usage
- Cite the tool appropriately if required
- Understand the underlying concepts, don't just use the tool blindly
