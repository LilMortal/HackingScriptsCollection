# SSH Connection Testing Tool

A professional Python tool for testing SSH connectivity to authorized systems. This tool helps network administrators and security professionals verify SSH connections, test authentication methods, and diagnose connectivity issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This tool is designed for testing systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.** Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any system.

## Features

- **Port Connectivity Testing**: Verify basic TCP connectivity to SSH ports
- **SSH Banner Retrieval**: Get SSH server version and banner information
- **Authentication Method Discovery**: Identify supported authentication methods
- **Password Authentication Testing**: Test username/password combinations
- **Key-based Authentication Testing**: Test SSH key authentication
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed test results and status reporting
- **Command-line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with multiple options
- **Secure Password Handling**: Secure password prompting to avoid command history
- **Verbose Logging**: Optional detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Timeout Configuration**: Configurable connection timeouts

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install Dependencies

The script uses standard Python libraries for basic functionality, but requires `paramiko` for advanced SSH testing features:

```bash
# Install paramiko for full SSH functionality
pip install paramiko

# Or install from requirements.txt if provided
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the Script

Save the script as `ssh_connection_tester.py` and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ssh_connection_tester.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H <hostname> [options]
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-H, --host` | Target hostname or IP address (required) |
| `-p, --port` | SSH port (default: 22) |
| `-u, --username` | Username for authentication testing |
| `-P, --password` | Password for authentication |
| `-k, --key-file` | Private key file path |
| `--key-passphrase` | Passphrase for encrypted private key |
| `-t, --timeout` | Connection timeout in seconds (default: 10) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose logging |
| `--prompt-password` | Securely prompt for password |

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Connectivity Test
```bash
# Test basic connectivity to an SSH server
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H 192.168.1.100
```

#### Password Authentication Test
```bash
# Test with username and password (password will be prompted)
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H server.example.com -u admin

# Test with username and password provided
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H 192.168.1.100 -u admin -P mypassword
```

#### Key-based Authentication Test
```bash
# Test with SSH private key
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H server.example.com -u user -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Test with encrypted private key (passphrase will be prompted)
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H 10.0.0.1 -u root --key-file /path/to/encrypted_key
```

#### Advanced Options
```bash
# Custom port with verbose output
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H 192.168.1.100 -p 2222 -u admin -v

# Custom timeout
python ssh_connection_tester.py -H slow-server.com -u user -t 30
```

## Output Interpretation

The tool provides comprehensive test results:

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: Full connectivity and authentication successful
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**: Connected but authentication failed
- üîó **CONNECTED**: Basic connectivity successful (no auth tested)
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Cannot establish basic connectivity

### Test Results Include
- Port reachability status
- SSH server banner information
- Available authentication methods
- Password authentication results (if tested)
- Key authentication results (if tested)
- Overall connection status

### Example Output

## Exit Codes

- `0`: Success (connection and/or authentication successful)
- `1`: Failure (connection or authentication failed)
- `130`: Interrupted by user (Ctrl+C)

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
- **Never test systems without permission**
- Use secure password prompting (avoid `-P` flag in shared environments)
- Store SSH keys securely with appropriate file permissions
- Review logs for any suspicious activity
- Use strong authentication methods

### Limitations
- Tool does not implement rate limiting (be mindful of login attempt policies)
- Does not support all SSH authentication methods (e.g., GSSAPI, keyboard-interactive)
- Basic host key verification (accepts all host keys)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "paramiko not available" Warning
```bash
# Install paramiko
pip install paramiko
```

#### Connection Timeout
- Increase timeout with `-t` option
- Check network connectivity
- Verify target host is running SSH service

#### Authentication Failures
- Verify username and password/key are correct
- Check if account is locked or disabled
- Verify key file permissions (should be 600)

#### Permission Denied
- Ensure SSH key file has correct permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- Verify username exists on target system
- Check SSH server configuration

### Debug Mode
Use `-v` flag for verbose output to help diagnose connection issues.

## Dependencies

### Required
- Python 3.6+
- Standard library modules: `argparse`, `socket`, `sys`, `time`, `logging`, `pathlib`, `typing`, `getpass`

### Optional (for full functionality)
- `paramiko`: SSH client library for Python
  ```bash
  pip install paramiko
  ```
