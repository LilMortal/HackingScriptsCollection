- Comprehensive logging and statistics
- Configurable attempt limits and delays
- Sample dictionary generation

## Features

- üìñ **Dictionary Loading**: Load passwords from text files
- üîÑ **Password Variations**: Generate common password variations (capitalization, numbers, symbols)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between attempts
- üìä **Statistics**: Detailed reporting of testing results
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**: Built-in attempt limits and responsible testing practices
- üéØ **Flexible Targeting**: Test against different usernames
- üìù **Verbose Logging**: Optional detailed output for analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the script**:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/login-tester/main/login_tester.py
   # or download manually
   ```

2. **Make the script executable** (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x login_tester.py
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python login_tester.py --help
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python login_tester.py -u <username> -d <dictionary_file>
```

### Command Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description | Default |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--username` | `-u` | Username to test | Required |
| `--dictionary` | `-d` | Path to password dictionary file | Required |
| `--delay` | | Delay between attempts (seconds) | 1.0 |
| `--max-attempts` | | Maximum number of attempts | 1000 |
| `--verbose` | | Enable verbose output | False |
| `--variations` | | Generate password variations | False |
| `--create-sample-dict` | | Create sample dictionary file | N/A |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | N/A |

### Examples

1. **Basic dictionary attack**:
   ```bash
   python login_tester.py -u admin -d common_passwords.txt
   ```

2. **Fast testing with verbose output**:
   ```bash
   python login_tester.py -u root -d wordlist.txt --delay 0.1 --verbose
   ```

3. **Limited attempts with variations**:
   ```bash
   python login_tester.py -u guest -d small_dict.txt --max-attempts 50 --variations
   ```

4. **Create a sample dictionary**:
   ```bash
   python login_tester.py --create-sample-dict sample_passwords.txt
   ```

5. **Professional penetration testing setup**:
   ```bash
   python login_tester.py -u admin -d rockyou.txt --delay 0.5 --max-attempts 10000 --variations
   ```

## Dictionary File Format

Dictionary files should be plain text files with one password per line:

```
password
123456
admin
root
# Comments start with #
qwerty
letmein
```

### Popular Password Dictionaries

- **rockyou.txt**: Most common password dictionary
- **SecLists**: Comprehensive password lists
- **10-million-password-list**: Extensive collection
- **Custom dictionaries**: Industry-specific or target-specific wordlists

## Sample Output

```
Loading dictionary from: common_passwords.txt
Loaded 50 passwords from dictionary
Starting dictionary attack on username: admin
Total passwords to test: 50
Delay between attempts: 1.0 seconds
Maximum attempts: 1000
--------------------------------------------------
Tested 10 passwords...
Tested 20 passwords...

[SUCCESS] Password found: 'password123'
Found after 23 attempts

Statistics:
Total attempts: 23
Time elapsed: 0:00:25.123456
Average attempts per second: 0.92
Password found: password123
```

## Password Variations

When using the `--variations` flag, the tool generates common password modifications:

- **Case variations**: `Password`, `PASSWORD`, `password`
- **Number suffixes**: `password1`, `password123`, `password2024`
- **Symbol suffixes**: `password!`, `password@`
- **Number prefixes**: `123password`
- **Year suffixes**: `password2023`, `password2024`, `password2025`

## Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Default 1-second delay between attempts
- Configurable delays to prevent system overload
- Maximum attempt limits to prevent excessive testing

### Responsible Testing
- Always obtain proper authorization
- Use appropriate delays for production systems
- Monitor system resources during testing
- Document all testing activities

### Detection Avoidance
- Randomize testing patterns
- Use distributed testing when appropriate
- Monitor for account lockout mechanisms
- Implement proper logging and cleanup

## Educational Use Cases

1. **Password Policy Training**: Demonstrate weak password vulnerabilities
2. **Security Awareness**: Show real-world attack scenarios
3. **Penetration Testing Education**: Teach authorized testing methodologies
4. **System Administration**: Test password strength policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Dictionary file not found"**:
   - Verify the file path is correct
   - Check file permissions
   - Use absolute paths if necessary

2. **"Permission denied"**:
   - Check script execution permissions
   - Verify file access rights

3. **Slow performance**:
   - Reduce delay with `--delay 0.1`
   - Limit attempts with `--max-attempts`
   - Use smaller dictionary files

4. **No passwords found**:
   - Try enabling `--variations`
   - Use larger dictionary files
   - Check if target system has lockout mechanisms

### Performance Tips

- Use SSD storage for large dictionaries
- Optimize dictionary files (remove duplicates)
- Consider parallel processing for large-scale testing
- Monitor system resources during testing
