# Network Scanner GUI

A legitimate network discovery tool designed for network administrators and security professionals to audit their own networks. This tool provides both a graphical user interface and command-line interface for scanning networks to discover active hosts and open ports.

## Description

The Network Scanner GUI is a Python-based application that helps network administrators identify active devices on their networks and discover open ports for security auditing purposes. It features concurrent scanning for improved performance, hostname resolution, and results export functionality.

### Key Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI built with tkinter
- **Command-Line Interface**: CLI mode for automation and scripting
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Multi-threaded scanning for better performance
- **Hostname Resolution**: Attempts to resolve hostnames for discovered IPs
- **Port Scanning**: Configurable port scanning with common defaults
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during scans
- **Results Export**: Export scan results to JSON format
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Standard Python libraries (no external dependencies required)

### Setup

1. **Download the script**:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourrepo/network-scanner-gui/main/network_scanner_gui.py
   # or
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourrepo/network-scanner-gui/main/network_scanner_gui.py
   ```

2. **Make the script executable** (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x network_scanner_gui.py
   ```

3. **Verify Python installation**:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

### Dependencies

This script uses only Python standard libraries:
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (usually included with Python)
- `socket` - Network operations
- `threading` - Multi-threading support
- `ipaddress` - IP address manipulation
- `argparse` - Command-line argument parsing
- `json` - JSON file operations
- `datetime` - Timestamp functionality

**Note**: On some Linux distributions, you may need to install tkinter separately:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo yum install tkinter
# or
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

## Usage

### GUI Mode (Default)

Launch the application with the graphical interface:

```bash
python3 network_scanner_gui.py
```

#### GUI Features:

1. **Target Network**: Enter the network range in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
2. **Ports**: Specify ports to scan (comma-separated, e.g., `22,80,443`)
3. **Start Scan**: Begin the network scan
4. **Stop Scan**: Terminate the current scan
5. **Clear Results**: Clear the results display
6. **Export Results**: Save results to a JSON file

### Command-Line Mode

Run the scanner in CLI mode for automation:

```bash
# Basic CLI scan
python3 network_scanner_gui.py --cli

# Scan specific network
python3 network_scanner_gui.py --cli --target 10.0.0.0/24

# Scan specific ports
python3 network_scanner_gui.py --cli --target 192.168.1.0/24 --ports 22,80,443,8080

# Scan single host
python3 network_scanner_gui.py --cli --target 192.168.1.1/32 --ports 22,80,443
```

### Example Commands

1. **Scan home network**:
   ```bash
   python3 network_scanner_gui.py --target 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

2. **Quick port scan**:
   ```bash
   python3 network_scanner_gui.py --cli --target 192.168.1.100/32 --ports 22,80,443
   ```

3. **Comprehensive scan**:
   ```bash
   python3 network_scanner_gui.py --cli --target 10.0.0.0/24 --ports 21,22,23,25,53,80,110,143,443,993,995
   ```

## Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `--target` | Target network range (CIDR notation) | `192.168.1.0/24` | `--target 10.0.0.0/24` |
| `--ports` | Comma-separated list of ports | `22,23,53,80,110,443,993,995` | `--ports 22,80,443` |
| `--cli` | Run in command-line mode (no GUI) | False | `--cli` |
| `--help` | Show help message | - | `--help` |

## Default Ports Scanned

The scanner checks these commonly used ports by default:
- **22**: SSH
- **23**: Telnet
- **53**: DNS
- **80**: HTTP
- **110**: POP3
- **443**: HTTPS
- **993**: IMAPS
- **995**: POP3S

## Output Format

### GUI Results
Results are displayed in the text area with the following information:
- IP address of active hosts
- Hostname (if resolvable)
- List of open ports
- Timestamp of discovery

### CLI Results
Command-line output shows:
- Progress updates during scanning
- Summary of discovered hosts
- Detailed port information for each host

### JSON Export
Exported results contain:
```json
[
  {
    "ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "hostname": "router.local",
    "ports": [22, 80, 443],
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456"
  }
]
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Concurrent Scanning**: Uses up to 50 concurrent threads for improved performance
- **Large Networks**: Scans of /16 or larger networks may take significant time
- **Timeout Settings**: Default 1-second timeout per port/host
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and network usage during large scans

## Ethical Use and Legal Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This tool is intended for legitimate network administration and security auditing purposes only.

### Legal Requirements:
- **Only scan networks you own** or have explicit written permission to test
- **Respect local laws** regarding network scanning and security testing
- **Unauthorized scanning** may violate computer crime laws in your jurisdiction
- **Corporate networks**: Ensure you have proper authorization before scanning

### Best Practices:
- Document your scanning activities
- Inform relevant parties before conducting scans
- Use during off-peak hours to minimize network impact
- Keep scan results confidential and secure

## Limitations

- **Detection Limitations**: May not detect all active hosts (firewalls, host-based filtering)
- **Port Scanning**: Only detects TCP ports, not UDP services
- **Performance**: Large network scans can be resource-intensive
- **Accuracy**: Results depend on network configuration and security settings
- **Platform**: GUI requires display server (X11, Wayland, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No module named 'tkinter'"**:
   ```bash
   # Install tkinter
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo yum install tkinter          # CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. **Permission denied errors**:
   ```bash
   # Run with appropriate permissions
   sudo python3 network_scanner_gui.py
   ```

3. **No hosts found**:
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify target network range
   - Consider firewall rules blocking scans

4. **Slow scanning**:
   - Reduce thread count for resource-constrained systems
   - Use smaller network ranges
   - Scan fewer ports
